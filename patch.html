		<h5>Variables vs Values</h5>
		<div class="description">
			<p>This example simply demonstrates how variables can be declared and initialized in Kotlin. Type specifiers come after the variable name, or
				they can be inferred if the variable is defined with a value. While "var" variables function like Java and can be assigned a new value, "val" 
				variables cannot.

            <h5>Fibonocci Sequence</h5>
            <div class="description">
                <p>This example takes in an number(count) in the main function, and prints out the first "count" numbers in the Fibonocci sequence. This is done
                    through three variables, one to track the current number, one to track to last number, and one to us a backup of the current number. This
                    program functions in a very similar way to a Java implementation of this program, with the two main differences being the "var" distinction and
                    the for loop.
                </p>
                <p>The "var" distinction is important becuase the values of the variables need to be able to change for this program to function. The for loop is
                    less verbose than a Java for loop, but achieves the same functionality of iterating count number of times over the variable "i".
