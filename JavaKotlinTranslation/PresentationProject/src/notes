- setNext()/setPrev() changed to setNextNode()/setPreviousNode() due to
a "platform declaration clash"
- primary constructor can literally just be parameters at the top of the class
- "?" next to an object denotes that the object can be null.  Kotlin is super
big on null-safety (null pointer exceptions are Java's problem like pointer/memory allocation
is C's big problem)
- ConcurrentModificationException() is imported automatically in to any JVM project (along
with many others that you would normally have to import in a Java class)
