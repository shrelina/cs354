The official documentation for Kotlin recommends installing
IntelliJ, which bundles the Kotlin compiler with it.  There is only
one Kotlin compiler (as far as we know), made by JetBrains.

To compile and run our programs, simply install IntelliJ.  If you
do not already have a JVM installed, IntelliJ will guide you through
the steps to install it.  Depending on which version of the JVM is installed,
you may have to set the target bytecode.  Kotlin will compile to Java bytecode
version 6 and 8.  We will be using bytecode version 8 for our projects.  However,
in our testing, we have learned that our sample programs will work for later versions
of Java, as they do not make use of the added functionality of those versions.  We
set our target bytecode to version 10.

To set the target bytecode in IntelliJ:
Open the File Tab -> Project Structure ->
Project Settings -> Project -> Project Language Level ->
Use the drop-down menu to set the language level to at most 10
(recommended 8 or 10).

Installing and using the Kotlin compiler can also be done from the command line:
