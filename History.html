  <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Kotlin was originally unveiled in July 2011 by JetBrains. However, it was not released until February 15, 2016. Shortly after at Google I/O 2017, "Google announced first-class support for Kotlin on Android"(1). By May 7, 2019, Google announced that Kotlin was it's preferred language for Android developers. </p>
  <h1>Design</h1>
    <p>Kotlin was designed to be an improved version of Java for mobile development, as it is objected-oriented and is fully interoperable with Java code. Kotlin classes tend to be much more concise than Java. For example, classes that soley hold data in Java require plenty of "boilerplate code" (ex. getters, setters, equals...) whereas Kotlin allows the data keyword to handle everything in the compiler.</p>
  <h2>Coroutines</h2>
    <p>For single-threaded systems (like Android), Java's solution is to make multiple background threads that can become complicated and hard to handle errors. Kotlin uses stackless threads, called coroutines, that use less memory to achieve code that appears synchronous. </p>
    <h2>Higher-Order Functions</h2>
      <p>Kotlin supports passing functions as parameters or returning functions from other functions. They can also be stored in data structures or variables</p>
    <h2>Objects</h2>
      <p>Every function in Kotlin is an object. Primitive data types are objects. </p>
    <h2>Inline Functions</h2>
      <p>Inline functions can be used to reduce the overhead created by allowing higher-order functions</p>
